Finanseer is a full-stack finance dashboard application that provides a display of different charts evaluating revenue, transactions, and expenses. Go to the predictions page to see a regression line and observe the machine learning at work with the 'Show Predicted Revenue For Next Year' button. 

Employed MongoDB was used as the primary database solution with AWS services for deployment in order to optimize data storage and retrieval processes for enhanced performance. The backend was built using Node.js and Express.js ensuring efficient data handling and seamless API integration. Machine Learning algorithms were integrated into the application to provide advanced financial analysis and prediction capabilities. An interactable frontend was created using React, Typescript, and Material-UI (MUI) for a responsive and visually appealing user interface. The backend was finally deployed using fly.io and the frontend through vercal.
